# The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomlecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.

Alternate link: http://tinyurl.com/pdbtable

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(x) + 1
```

We found a function called `gsub()` now wwe can figure out how it works.

```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in the table

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Apply across all columns:

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum) 
totals
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(215684 / 249751891 * 100)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?




# 2. Visualizinf Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol* (mol-star) homepage:
https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with PDB code 1HSG

![](1HSG.png)

Show the ASP 25 amino acids:

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor showing the two important ASP 25 amino acids](2HSG.png)

## Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an important protein:

```{r}
library(bio3d)


hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```


```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol*....
